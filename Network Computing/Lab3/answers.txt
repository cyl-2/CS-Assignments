-- Problem 1 --
I didn't understand how HTTP requests are sent to server using GET, so I googled the structure of 
the GET method and read about the mechanics of the HTTP requests in terms of how they relate to the socket 
module in python. After some trial and error, I figured out the code to to get the HTTP request working correctly.

-- Problem 2 --
I was confused by the command line argument requirement of this lab, I originally thought I just had to prompt the user 
for three inputs (host, port and file) as three separate input variables but then I realised that I was actually supposed 
to run the client file using "python ./client_solution.py localhost 6789 HelloWorld.html". So then I did some googling 
to find out how to use and how to code for cmd line arguments. I found out that I had to import a module called 
"sys" in order to parse command line arguments.
